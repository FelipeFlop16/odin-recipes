        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Filling:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked, chopped chicken</li>
            <li>2 cans (4-ounces each) green chiles, lightly drained</li>
            <li>8-ounce package of cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 can (15-ounces) white or black beans, rinsed, and drained</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion, about 1/2 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup green chile enchilada sauce or salsa verde</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream, light or regular</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Assembly:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces (about 2 cups) Monterey jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>10 soft taco size flour or corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Handful of chopped fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a 9X13-inch baking pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and green chiles. Mix well. Add the chicken, beans, cilantro and lime juice. Mix to combine. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> in a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens and starts to turn translucent, about 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the onions and stir well. Cook for 1 minute, stirring. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk. As you whisk and the mixture cooks, the flour will get less lumpy around the onions and the mixture will become smooth.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat until the mixture is bubbling and has thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the salt and pepper. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the enchilada sauce and sour cream.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/4 cup of the sauce in a thin layer on the bottom of the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with about 1/2 cup of the chicken/cream cheese filling. Top with a small handful of shredded cheese, a couple tablepoons for each enchilada. Save at least 1/2 cup cheese for the top of the enchiladas.</li>
            <li>Roll the tortillas up and place seam side down in the prepared baking dish. Continue filling enchiladas until the dish is full.</li>
            <li>Pour the white sauce over the top of the enchiladas and spread evenly. Top with remaining cheese. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the enchiladas are bubbling, hot and lightly browned. Sprinkle fresh cilantro over the top and serve.</li>
        </ol>
